                Cryptocurrency ownership comes with a critical challenge: if something happens to you, 
                your digital assets could be lost forever. Traditional inheritance methods don't work 
                with decentralized assets, leaving families without access to potentially significant wealth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Existing solutions are either too complex for average users or lack the real-world 
                connectivity needed for reliable inheritance triggers. Noah solves this by creating 
                a bridge between the digital and physical worlds.

                Noah's dead man switch technology provides a secure, automated way to ensure your 
                cryptocurrency is safely inherited. By combining blockchain security with real-world 
                verification systems, we create a foolproof inheritance mechanism.

                Our platform monitors your activity and, when combined with real-world verification 
                triggers, can automatically transfer your assets to designated beneficiaries when 
                you're no longer able to manage them yourself.
