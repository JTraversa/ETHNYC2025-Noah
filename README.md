# Noah - A revolutionary hardware redundancy, fund recovery, and inheritance solution that guarantees your crypto assets will never be lost.


Noah's dead man switch technology provides a secure, automated way to ensure your cryptocurrency is safely inherited. By combining blockchain security with real-world verification systems, we create a foolproof inheritance mechanism.

Our platform monitors your activity and, when combined with real-world verification triggers, can automatically transfer your assets to designated beneficiaries when you're no longer able to manage them yourself.
